# This is your practice exam for second semster Intro to CS 2017

Step 1:  Complete the Code is Files already created:
  # Functions.py
  # Turtle.py
  # Loops.py
  # Range.Function.py
  # Encrypt.py

Step 2:  Create a new Python File and name it "MyFile.py"

Step 3:  In MyFile.py, define a function for the turtle program that will draw
a regular polygon with 'n' sides.

Step 4:  Add the necessary code that will import this funtion from MyFile.py into
Turtle.py and run the function.  (In other words, define the function in one file
  and run it in the other!  USe import to do this!)

Step 5:  Write your own file (Call it MyEncrypt.py) that will contain an encryption
function THAT YOU MAKE UP.  Use it on the string:
  *"The lazy Student Never Gets Paid!"*

  **DO NOT RUN YOUR CODE UNTIL AFTER YOUR PARTNER HAS DONE STEP 6!!!**

Step 6: Give you key to a partner and create a new message.  Write down the result
of the encryption YOU SHOULD GET when it is run.

Step 7: Run the program to determine if you were able to do it correctly (in your mind!)
#Marcus did it correctly
